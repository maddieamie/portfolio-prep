## Question Preps
Queer Creative & Developer.
Creative Developer with an interest in mobile applications, gaming, and accessibility programming.

## Professional Pitch
I have realized that my true passion lies in mentoring young people through a different medium than education. My interest in coding was sparked by my love for mathematics and problem-solving. I am determined to create applications that are not only beautiful but also inclusive and accessible to all. My dream is to create mobile leisure games that make people happy, ones that anyone can play and feel successful. I believe my creativity as an artist and my expertise as a math teacher will blend seamlessly into a fulfilling career in software development.

## Why tech is awesome
In the future, I envision a world where everyone has access to art and technology, regardless of their background or abilities. I am committed to creating software that not only delights but also empowers everyone. I hope everyone will feel the ability to create something and see it work.
